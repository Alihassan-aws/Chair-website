                            <p>Each of our products comes with specific care instructions. As a general rule, we recommend using a soft, dry cloth to dust your furniture regularly. For spills, blot immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or furniture polish. For wood furniture, keep away from direct sunlight and heat sources to prevent fading and warping. Upholstered items should be vacuumed regularly and professionally cleaned as needed.</p>
